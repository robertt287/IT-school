//11. Write a Java program where you declare four integer variables: a, b, c, and d. Assign them values of 10, 20, 30, and 40 respectively.
// Create two more variables additionResult and multiplicationResult.
// Set additionResult to the sum of a and b and multiplicationResult to the product of c and d. Print the values of additionResult and multiplicationResult.
